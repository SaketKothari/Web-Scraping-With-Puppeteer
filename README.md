# web-scraping-with-puppeteer
Simple script to scrape data from a [web-page](https://www.traversymedia.com) using Puppeteer

Puppeteer is a Node.js library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome/Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer runs in headless mode by default, but can be configured to run in full (non-headless) Chrome/Chromium.

#
Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:

* Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
* Crawl a SPA (Single-Page Application) and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. "SSR" (Server-Side Rendering)).
* Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.
* Create an automated testing environment using the latest JavaScript and browser features.
* Capture a timeline trace of your site to help diagnose performance issues.
* Test Chrome Extensions.

## Usage
Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the script

```bash
npm start
```
